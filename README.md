**!!IMPORTANT GAME TIPS!!**

If multiplayer side of the game needed to be tested by the teachers, during the game, we can press button **X** and it intiiates the multiplayer level.However, multiplayer server needs to be open that time. After hitting X or successfully making out to the 4th level, Clear and Fade function is called and it game hangs on white screen, waiting for another player.If other player also arrives, multiplayer game starts.

**MORE IMPORTANT TIPS ABOUT THE GAME**

When we want to check leaderboards in GUI, it produces a new stage for us.Mainmenu stage stays under the newly created leaderboard stage.We can easily move leaderboard stage and see mainmenu is under it.

In multiplayer part, server decides which player has won.

In the game, we move with arrow keys and fire with space key.

Pismaniyes(greeen circles) upgrade the weapon of player,thus damage increases.Pismaniyes also increase the health of the consumer.

If our player dies, we simply push "**R**" button and start again from the first level.

After each level, score is updated in the database.
