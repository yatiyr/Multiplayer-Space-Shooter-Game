**!!IMPORTANT GAME TIPS!!**

If multiplayer side of the game needed to be tested by the teachers, during the game, we can press button **X** and it intiiates the multiplayer level.However, multiplayer server needs to be open that time. After hitting X or successfully making out to the 4th level, Clear and Fade function is called and it game hangs on white screen, waiting for another player.If other player also arrives, multiplayer game starts.
