**SOME IMPORTANT TIPS ABOUT THE GAME**

When we want to check leaderboards in GUI, it produces a new stage for us.Mainmenu stage stays under the newly created leaderboard stage.We can easily move leaderboard stage and see mainmenu is under it.

In multiplayer part, server decides which player has won.

In the game, we move with arrow keys and fire with space key.

Pismaniyes(greeen circles) upgrade the weapon of player,thus damage increases.Pismaniyes also increase the health of the consumer.

If our player dies, we simply push "**R**" button and start again from the first level.

After each level, score is updated in the database.
